# Project Name
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.     You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to   predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to     invest in them or not.
- The company wants to know:
  -Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house                                     
  -How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- The 'Train.csv' dataset is being used

## Conclusions
- we got a decent score for both Ridge and Lasso regression.                     
  - Ridge : Train :90.9 Test :87.4                                               
  - Lasso : Train :89.8 Test :86.4

## Technologies Used
- Ridge Regression
